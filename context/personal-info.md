# Personal Info

This file captures who you are and how this workspace supports your work. Claude reads this during /prime to understand your role and tailor assistance accordingly.

## How This Connects

- `business-info.md` sets the organizational stage
- This file defines your place within it
- `strategy.md` outlines what you're working toward
- `current-data.md` provides metrics that inform decisions

## Your Role

<!-- REPLACE the example below with your actual role -->

**Example:** I'm the Head of Marketing at Acme Corp. I report to the CEO and manage a team of 4 (2 content writers, 1 designer, 1 growth marketer). I own the full marketing funnel from awareness through to lead qualification, and I'm accountable for pipeline contribution targets each quarter.

## Key Responsibilities

<!-- REPLACE with your actual responsibilities -->

**Example:**
- Content strategy and editorial calendar across blog, YouTube, and LinkedIn
- Campaign planning and execution (product launches, seasonal pushes)
- Marketing analytics and reporting to leadership
- Brand positioning and messaging
- Budget management (~$15K/month across paid and tools)

## How This Workspace Helps

<!-- REPLACE with what you actually want to use this for -->

**Example:** I want to use this workspace to automate my weekly reporting, speed up competitive research, draft campaign briefs from templates, and analyze content performance without manually pulling data from 5 different dashboards. The recurring tasks I do every week that eat the most time are: the Monday metrics pull, the Wednesday content calendar update, and the Friday stakeholder report.

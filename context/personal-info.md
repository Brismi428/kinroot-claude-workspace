# Personal Info

## How This Connects

- `business-info.md` sets the organizational stage
- This file defines your place within it
- `strategy.md` outlines what you're working toward
- `current-data.md` provides metrics that inform decisions

## Your Role

I'm the Co-Founder & COO at Kinroot. I wear many hats — product strategy, operations, growth, and marketing. As a non-technical co-founder, I focus on the business side while working closely with our technical co-founder on product decisions. I'm the primary driver of our beta program and go-to-market strategy.

## Key Responsibilities

- Product strategy and feature prioritization
- Operations and day-to-day business decisions
- Beta program management (currently 17 testers)
- Growth strategy and user acquisition
- Marketing content and brand positioning
- Feature planning and roadmap coordination
- Community building and user relationships

## How This Workspace Helps

I use this workspace to accelerate the strategic and operational work that comes with building Kinroot:

- **Research:** Competitive analysis, market trends, parenting app landscape
- **Planning:** Feature specs, marketing campaigns, growth experiments
- **Communications:** Beta tester emails, marketing copy, investor updates, social content
- **Analysis:** Beta feedback synthesis, metrics tracking, pricing strategy
- **Strategy:** Launch planning, feature prioritization, partnership opportunities
- **Content:** Blog posts, social media, landing page copy, email sequences

The recurring tasks I need help with most: weekly beta progress reviews, competitive research, drafting communications to testers, and thinking through feature trade-offs.

- `current-data.md` tracks progress against these priorities

## Current Focus Period

<!-- REPLACE with your actual timeframe -->

**Example:** Q1 2026 (January - March)

## Strategic Priorities

<!-- REPLACE with your actual priorities — aim for 2-5 -->

**Example:**

1. **Hit 120 marketing-qualified leads this quarter** — We need to increase MQL volume by 30% vs. last quarter to support the sales team's pipeline targets. Primary levers are content marketing (blog + YouTube) and a new webinar series launching in February.

2. **Launch the Acme Docs campaign** — The docs add-on has been live for 6 months but has low awareness among existing customers. Need a targeted campaign to drive cross-sell adoption. Target: 50 existing customers trialing Docs by end of Q1.

3. **Reduce cost per lead by 15%** — Our paid spend is inefficient. Need to audit current channels, kill underperformers, and double down on what's working. Current CPL is ~$125, target is $106.

4. **Build the content engine** — Shift from ad-hoc content to a systematic calendar with 3 blog posts/week and 1 YouTube video/week. Repurpose everything across LinkedIn and email.

## What Success Looks Like

<!-- REPLACE with your actual success criteria -->

**Example:** By end of Q1, we've hit 120 MQLs, the Docs campaign is live and showing early traction, CPL is trending toward $106, and the content calendar has been running consistently for 6+ weeks with measurable traffic growth.

## Key Decisions or Open Questions

<!-- REPLACE with your actual open questions -->

**Example:**
- Should we invest in a paid community (Slack/Discord) for customers, or is that a distraction from lead gen?
- The CEO wants to explore a partner channel — is that my responsibility or should it sit with sales?
- We're debating whether to hire a 5th person (SEO specialist) or outsource SEO to an agency. Need to decide by mid-February.

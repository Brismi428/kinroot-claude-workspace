## How This Connects

- `personal-info.md` defines your role and responsibilities
- This file captures what success looks like right now
- `current-data.md` tracks progress against these priorities

## Current Focus Period

Q1 2026 (January – March)

## Strategic Priorities

### 1. Beta Feedback & Iteration

Collect and act on feedback from our 17 beta testers. The goal is to identify and fix UX friction, improve core flows, and validate that the product solves real problems before expanding access.

- Monitor tester activity and engagement patterns
- Prioritize bug fixes and UX improvements based on feedback
- Ensure core modules (Calendar, Mealflow, Village, Tasks) are solid
- Validate the free-to-Plus upgrade path works smoothly

### 2. Growth & User Acquisition

Begin building the foundation for growth beyond closed beta. This means expanding the beta cohort, establishing marketing presence, and developing a content strategy.

- Expand beta from 17 to a larger cohort (target TBD based on feedback quality)
- Build marketing presence on channels where single parents spend time
- Develop content strategy: blog posts, social content, community engagement
- Start building an email list / waitlist for public launch

### 3. New Feature Development

Build out Premium Plus value proposition and key integrations that testers are requesting.

- AI-powered features for Premium Plus tier (meal suggestions, smart scheduling)
- Calendar integrations (Google Calendar, iCal sync)
- Smart reminders and notifications
- Continued polish on existing modules

## What Success Looks Like

By end of Q1 2026:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Weekly Active Engaged Users (WAEU) | 60% of beta testers by Month 3 |
| Week 1 Retention | 80% |
| Free → Plus Conversion | 15% |

Beta testers are actively using the product weekly, core flows feel polished, and we have a clear picture of what needs to happen before public launch.

## Key Decisions & Open Questions

- **Public launch timing:** When do we open access? What criteria need to be met?
- **AI feature prioritization:** Which AI features deliver the most value for Premium Plus? Meal suggestions? Smart scheduling? Auto-categorization?
- **Marketing channel strategy:** Where do single parents congregate online? Which channels give us the best ROI for early growth?
- **Pricing validation:** Is $12.99/$24.99 the right split? Do beta testers perceive enough value in Premium Plus?
- **Village Network moderation:** As we grow, what moderation strategy keeps the community safe without heavy overhead?

# Business Info

This file provides background on the organization or business you operate within. It sets the stage for understanding your role (personal-info.md) and strategic priorities (strategy.md).

## How This Connects

- This file establishes organizational context
- `personal-info.md` defines your role within this org
- `strategy.md` captures the goals you're driving toward
- `current-data.md` tracks progress and informs decisions

## Organization Overview

<!-- REPLACE the example below with your actual business -->

**Example:** Acme Corp is a B2B SaaS company that provides project management tools for mid-market construction firms. Founded in 2020, we serve ~400 customers across the US and Canada. Our mission is to eliminate the communication gaps that cause construction delays and cost overruns.

## Products / Services / Focus Areas

<!-- REPLACE with your actual offerings -->

**Example:**
- **Acme PM** — our core project management platform (web + mobile), $299/mo per team
- **Acme Docs** — document management add-on, launched 6 months ago, $99/mo
- **Professional Services** — onboarding and custom workflow setup, billed hourly

## Key Context

<!-- REPLACE with important background Claude should know -->

**Example:** We're a 35-person team (Series A, raised $8M in 2023). We're profitable on a unit-economics basis but still burning ~$80K/month on growth. The market is competitive — Procore is the 800lb gorilla, and there are 3-4 newer entrants targeting the same mid-market segment. Our differentiation is simplicity and speed of onboarding (avg 2 days vs. industry standard of 2-4 weeks). We're entering a critical phase: need to hit $5M ARR by end of year to position for Series B.
